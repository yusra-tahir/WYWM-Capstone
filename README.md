# WYWM-Capstone - Inventory Management System

A small retail business that sells a variety of products are experiencing issues with managing their inventory and keeping track of what products are in stock, what needs to be reordered, and how much has been sold. As a result, I have developed an inventory management system to help the business better manage the inventory and sales data.

### The Scope: 

- The system will be a web application accessed through a browser
- The system will store and retrieve data from an SQL database
- Users will be able to add, update, and delete inventory items
- Users will be able to view the current inventory and filter by category and search for specific items
- Users will be able to generate reports on inventory levels and sales data T
- The system will not handle financial transactions or customer data
